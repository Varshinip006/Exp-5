# Aim
To study the problem statement, SRS document and draw all the UML diagrams of a Student Enrollment Management System.

# SRS (Procedure):

## Step 1: Problem Identification

## Step 2: Requirement Analysis

Users: Admin, Staff, and Student.      
Main Functions: Student registration, course enrollment, fee payment, record updating, and report generation.    
Non-Functional Needs: Security, reliability, and an easy-to-use interface.
